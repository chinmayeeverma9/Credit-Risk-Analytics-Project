# Credit-Risk-Analytics-using PD modelling
Develop a Python-based credit risk analysis project using a Probability of Default (PD) model to assess borrowers' creditworthiness. Clean and preprocess data, conduct EDA and implement a fine-tuned supervised learning model. Demonstrate actionable insights and model effectiveness in proactive credit risk management.


# Step 1: Business Context and Objective
Context: The project aims to predict customer defaults to assist banks in making credit decisions.
Objective: Develop a model to identify potential defaulters.

# Step 2: Data Collection and Preparation
Tasks: Import raw data, clean, and preprocess it.
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy

# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Tasks: Analyze data to understand distributions and relationships.
Libraries Used: matplotlib, seaborn

# Step 4: Feature Engineering
Tasks: Create new features, handle categorical variables.
Libraries Used: pandas, scikit-learn

# Step 5: Model Development
Tasks: Train models using logistic regression and decision tree classifiers.
Libraries Used: scikit-learn

# Step 6: Model Evaluation
Tasks: Evaluate models using ROC curves and accuracy metrics.
Libraries Used: scikit-learn, matplotlib

# Step 7: Model Deployment
Tasks: Save and load models using pickle.
Libraries Used: pickle

# Step 8: Documentation and Summary
Tasks: Summarize findings and document the process.
